Subject: Following Up: Acme Corp Website Redesign - Next Steps

Dear Sarah,

It was a pleasure speaking with you and the team yesterday regarding the Acme Corp website redesign. We're excited to partner with you on this project!

Just to recap, we confirmed the scope, timeline, and budget as discussed – a modern, user-friendly website with e-commerce functionality, content migration for approximately 150 pages, and a full launch targeted for August 15th.

As promised, I'm sending over the contract outlining these details today. Alex and Maya are already beginning work on initial design concepts, which we'll review together in our follow-up meeting next Friday, May 10th.

Please let me know if you have any questions in the meantime. We look forward to a successful project!

Best regards,

Alex
